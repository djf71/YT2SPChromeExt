12/18: 
    - Have OAuth 2.0 firt part working. This gives an initial access code which can be used to get an access token
    - Currently the flow is the following: 
        1) popup.js calls the spotifyOAuth_URL_Gen.js function
            - This function is where information like clientID, redirectURI, scope, authURL, codeVerifier, ect. are currently assigned/stored
            - This returns the authorization URL to popup.js 
        2) popup.js sends the authorization URL to background.js in a message
        3) background.js calls chromeWebAuthFlow which starts the OAuth 2.0 process
        4) background.js then gets the access code from the auth flow 

    - I need to use this access code in a POST request to the Spotify API to get an access token 
        - This POST request needs the information that is stored in the spotifyOAuth_URL_Gen.js file
        - I probably need to find a new place for this information so I dont have to pass it all over the place

    TO DOs: 
        X Put information in background.js and move all the logic of spotifyOAuth_URL_Gen.js into functions in backgorund.js
            X See if I can do this without causing issues
        
        X Need to now create function to get access token
            - Need to eventually clean this up so it is not saving when it doesnt need to and is 
                asynced correctly

        - Need to create function to get user's playlists
        
        - Need to create a function to add song to user playlist 
        - Need to add drop down functionaltiy so user can choose which playlist to add song to 
        - Need to add functionality if song is not found or detected
